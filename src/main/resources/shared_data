Let's go big: we want to scale out and use all the horse power of our new quad core server.
vertx run webserver.js -instances 2
This command will deploy two instances of webserver.js which autonomously will deploy also two instances of webclient.js.
That's a total of four verticles. Now, generally a quad core processor comes with multithreading, so you could have even better parallelism doubling the numbers, but you got the concept.

Note that these verticles are standalone independent services, so whenever a webserver sends a message to "webclient_address" any of the webclient instances can respond. 
This is true also when you have a cluster: two different machines, running vert.x in cluster mode might find their eventbus messages answered by remote verticles.
Let's try this right away. W
